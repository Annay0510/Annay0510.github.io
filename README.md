# Annay0510.github.io (Treasure Hunt) 

Explanation of Technologies used: 
This game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There were updates committed to github everyday during project week. 

The approach taken:
I thought about how I wanted the game to go. I knew I wanted the player to answer riddles to advance on the treasure map and get the treasure. I then found my images online and wireframed my game on paper. I built out my HTML first making sure I had my buttons on separate divs. That way i could move them around on the treasure map. Then I worked on my CSS, styling everything. Alter that, I came up with my riddles. I wanted to make them clever, and entertaining to the players. I also came up with the alert messages for the win state and the lose state. Then I used prompt functions, alerts, and animation to make the game come together.

Unsolved problems:
I was able to solve all the issues with my game with the help of my instructor, TA's, peers, and the internet/youtube videos. I would have loved to make this game cooler. It's basic but entertaining. I would have liked to have several choices for questions on each quest, and the ability to play against another player, instead of just playing against the computer.
